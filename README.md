Welcome to Project-7! This project demonstrates how to deploy a Portfolio app on AWS S3 using GitHub Actions, enabling Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Repository integration.

## What is GitHub Actions? 🤖

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD platform that automates your build, test, and deployment pipelines. It allows you to create workflows that build and test every pull request or deploy merged pull requests to production seamlessly. It goes beyond just DevOps and can run workflows based on various events within your repository.

## Project Execution Steps 📝

To get started with the deployment, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository "my_portfolio."
2. Add and commit your Portfolio app's code to the repository.
3. Create an S3 Bucket named "my-portfolio-bucket" and allow public access.
4. Generate IAM User credentials with sufficient permissions for GitHub Actions.
5. Set up GitHub Secrets for securely storing AWS credentials.
6. Create a GitHub Actions workflow in your repository.
7. Commit changes and trigger the deployment using GitHub Actions.
8. Enable static website hosting for the S3 Bucket.
9. Access your deployed Portfolio website on the provided URL endpoint.

## Conclusion 🎯

By the end of this project, you'll have your Portfolio app hosted on AWS S3, accessible through GitHub Actions' CI/CD pipeline. Embrace automation, showcase your projects, and improve your web development skills!

Happy coding! 🚀🌟
